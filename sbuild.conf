# sbuild.conf: global sbuild settings that will survive an upgrade.
# This makes it easier to drop this sbuild version into a buildd
# setting.  (Also see example.sbuildrc.)
#
# Default settings are commented out.
# Note that all possible settings are listed here.  Many may be set on
# the command-line, and do not normally need setting here,
# e.g. $verbose.  Others need setting by each individual user in their
# ~/.sbuildrc, but are listed here for completeness.

## DPKG-BUILDPACKAGE OPTIONS
##

# nor .changes files shall be signed automatically.

# defaults to the current working directory.  $HOME/build is another
# common configuration.
