Welcome to sbuild 0.57.0.  Please read these release notes carefully.

Full installation instructions are provided in the INSTALL file.  The
README file also contains more specific notes regarding building and
configuration.

* Major changes in 0.57.0:

  1) All programs have been moved from /usr/share/sbuild to /usr/bin
     (with the exception of dobuildlog), with an sbuild- prefix.  In
     some cases, the names have been changed.  The older programs are
     still available under /usr/lib/sbuild.

  2) All programs (with the exception of dobuildlog) now have manual
     pages.

  3) sbuild now runs apt-get with APT::Install-Recommends set to
     false.

  4) sbuild can be optionally configured to use an alternative
     algorithm to compute build dependencies, to allow installation of
     alternative build dependencies.

  5) sbuild-createchroot (formerly buildd.chroot) now creates a fully
     working chroot, with no manual setup required other than adding
     the schroot configuration.
