Welcome to sbuild 0.60.1.  Please read these release notes carefully.

Full installation instructions are provided in the INSTALL file.  The
README file also contains more specific notes regarding building and
configuration.

* Major changes in 0.60.1:

  1) Improvements in building of dpkg-source v3 source formats.

  2) sbuild includes a new option --no-source to disable building
     of source packages.  This is the reciprocal of the existing
     --source option.

* Major changes in 0.60.0:

  1) sbuild no longer defaults the distribution to "unstable", and
     requires setting by hand with --distribution unless configured in
     .sbuildrc.  This is to prevent accidental uploads to the wrong
     distribution.

  2) sbuild now lists all packages (including versions) installed in
     the build chroot in the package build log.  This may aid
     identifying problems with builds using buggy or outdated package
     versions.

  3) With a recent versions of man-db (>= 2.5.6-4), man-db will be
     configured not to rebuild its database during package
     installation and removal in the build chroot.

  4) sbuild has added new options to allow APT cleaning, upgrading and
     dist-upgrading of the build chroot, in addition to the existing
     updating option.

  5) buildd has been synched with the buildd code in use on the Debian
     buildd infrastructure, and is now in use on most, if not all,
     running buildds.  It has undergone extensive changes since the
     previous release, and is now suitable for production use.  Note
     that the packaged version of wanna-build is not yet ready for use
     with buildd.

  6) buildd no longer bind mounts /home into the chroot.

  7) buildd now handles all wanna-build interaction.  All sbuild
     wanna-build usage has been removed, including the
     --auto-give-back and --database options.

* Major changes in 0.59.0:

  1) The wanna-build options --no-propagation and
     --no-down-propagation have been removed.  These options no longer
     have any effect, and were only present for backward-compatibility
     with older versions of buildd.  buildd no longer uses these
     options, making it safe to remove them.

  2) The wanna-build configuration options used by buildd in
     buildd.conf have been renamed for better compatibility with future
     planned sbuild changes.  buildd.conf will require updating with the
     new option names:

     ┌───────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────┐
     │ old                   │ new                                 │
     ├───────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────┤
     │ $wanna_build_dbbase   │ $wanna_build_db_name                │
     │ $wanna_build_user     │ $wanna_build_db_user                │
     │ $ssh_user             │ $wanna_build_ssh_user               │
     │ $ssh_host             │ $wanna_build_ssh_host               │
     │ $ssh_socket           │ $wanna_build_ssh_socket             │
     │ @ssh_options          │ $wanna_build_ssh_options (arrayref) │
     └───────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────┘

  3) sbuild will set the "attempted" and "given-back" states for
     certain failures.  If wanna-build updates are configured with
     --database and --auto-give-back by buildd, it will set the
     "built" state on build completion, and "attempted" if the build
     failed.  As before, "given-back" will be set for most other
     failure conditions.

* Major changes in 0.58.6:

  None.

* Major changes in 0.58.5:

  None.

* Major changes in 0.58.4:

  None.

* Major changes in 0.58.3:

  1) The broken options --add-depends and --force-depends have been
     replaced by --add-depends, --add-conflicts, --add-depends-indep
     and --add-conflicts-indep.  These options each take a single
     dependency, using the same dependency syntax one would use in
     debian/control.

  2) The wanna-build configuration has been moved back to
     /etc/buildd/wanna-build.conf.  However, the option names have
     been renamed and your configuration will require updating.

  3) When reading configuration files, stricter checking is performed.
     If you see a "Global symbol "$x" requires explicit package
     name" error, then the option $x is not valid and should be
     removed from the configuration file indicated.

  4) The maintainer name no longer defaults to DEBEMAIL as in most
     cases the maintainer in the .dsc should be used.

* Major changes in 0.58.2:

  None.

* Major changes in 0.58.1:

  None.

* Major changes in 0.58.0:

  1) The configuration option @no_auto_upgrade, which was no longer
     used, has been removed.  To prevent packages being upgraded
     automatically, please use sbuild-hold.  See sbuild-hold(1).

  2) The configuration option $chroot_mode has been restored, allowing
     chroot access by both schroot (which remains the default) and
     sudo.

  3) A new configuration option $chroot_split has been added.  This
     allows both schroot and sudo chroot access to be modified to run
     apt/dpkg on the host system.  Note that schroot needs sudo to run
     commands as root on the host system.

  4) Deprecated commands from /usr/lib/sbuild have been removed.
     Please use the sbuild-* replacements found in /usr/bin.

  5) The maintainer name defaults to DEBEMAIL if set in the
     environment, so no longer needs setting explicitly in .sbuildrc.

  6) Unless configured as a buildd ($sbuild_mode), when using sudo
     chroot access, chroots are searched for in /etc/sbuild/chroots.
     This directory should contain symlinks to the chroots, with the
     distribution name being the name of the symlink.  Buildd mode
     will continue to use the old method of current-$distribution
     symlinks in the current directory.

  7) The log format used for build logs has been updated to use a more
     readable format, and is now encoded in UTF-8 rather than
     US-ASCII.  Code which parses the log file may need to be updated
     to handle the new format.  Further log format changes made in the
     future.

  8) All commands now have a corresponding manual page.

  9) The wanna-build configuration has moved from
     /etc/wanna-build/wanna-build.conf into /etc/sbuild/sbuild.conf as
     part of ongoing refactoring work.  It is expected that this will
     be split into a separate file in the future once this work is
     completed.

  10) wanna-build can now correctly dump and restore its databases
      using the --export and --import options.  Note that
      wanna-build-catmldbm and related commands can not correctly dump
      the current database format, can not be used to restore the dump
      and will be removed in the future.

  11) The wanna-build commands do-merge-packages and do-merge-quinn
      have been renamed to wanna-build-merge-packages and
      wanna-build-merge-quinn.

  12) wanna-build changes from the official Debian wanna-build
      installation have been merged.

  13) Initial support for a wanna-build PostgreSQL backend backend has
      been added, but is not currently functional.  The database
      schema is also included, but not yet finalised.

* Major changes in 0.57.5:

  1) sbuild-createchroot now supports most of the options found in
     debootstrap.  It no longer adds main and contrib to
     /etc/apt/sources.list in the chroot (the components are now
     specified with --components instead of being hard-coded).

  2) All sbuild commands now support --help and --version options.

  3) sbuild-abort and sbuild have been updated to work with the
     current dpkg-buildpackage and handle build termination
     gracefully.

* Major changes in 0.57.4:

  None.

* Major changes in 0.57.3:

  None.

* Major changes in 0.57.2:

  1) The new dpkg source format is now supported.

  2) The chroot to build in may be specified independently of the
     distribution.

  3) Purging of files in the chroot has been made more reliable, by
     putting all of the build files in a single temporary directory
     which is purged after the build completes.

  4) $mailto no longer needs setting in .sbuildrc if not running as a
     buildd.

  5) An option to always update the APT package list has been added
     ($apt_update in sbuild.conf).

  6) wanna-build, the database used to track which packages need
     rebuilding, has been added as a separate package.

* Major changes in 0.57.1:

  1) While not used in the Debian packaging, the buildd and
     wanna-build sources have been merged from the separate buildd.git
     repository.  They will be built as packages in a future release.

  2) Helper scripts in the Debian package have been moved from
     /usr/lib/sbuild back to /usr/share/sbuild, where they were
     located prior to 0.57.0.

  3) schroot "directory" type chroots are now purged correctly
     following a package build.

* Major changes in 0.57.0:

  1) All programs have been moved from /usr/share/sbuild to /usr/bin
     (with the exception of dobuildlog), with an sbuild- prefix.  In
     some cases, the names have been changed.  The older programs are
     still available under /usr/lib/sbuild.

  2) All programs (with the exception of dobuildlog) now have manual
     pages.

  3) sbuild now runs apt-get with APT::Install-Recommends set to
     false.

  4) sbuild can be optionally configured to use an alternative
     algorithm to compute build dependencies, to allow installation of
     alternative build dependencies.

  5) sbuild-createchroot (formerly buildd.chroot) now creates a fully
     working chroot, with no manual setup required other than adding
     the schroot configuration.
