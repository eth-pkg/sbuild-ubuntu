sbuild for Debian
-----------------

setup
=====

  The full procedure for setting up a chroot and setting up a user is
  documented in sbuild-setup(7).  Existing users may need to review
  their sudo setup, due to changes in sudo (User setup, part 4).

chroots
=======

  If you don't have an existing chroot, README-buildd.chroot
  describes how to set one up and season it for a user.


helper scripts
==============

  /usr/share/sbuild/README.bins describes the helper shell scripts
  that are in /usr/share/sbuild.


extras
======

  avg-build-times and avg-build-space
  -----------------------------------
  sbuild will keep databases of the time and space that builds
  require if a couple files exist:

    touch /var/lib/sbuild/avg-build-{times,space}
    chmod 664 /var/lib/sbuild/avg-build-{times,space}
    chgrp sbuild /var/lib/sbuild/avg-build-{times,space}

  These have limited usefulness outside buildd context....  See
  the avg-pkg-build-time man page for more info.

  src-deps
  --------
  Manual source dependencies are obsolete.  While sbuild will
  continue to support source-dependencies files for Etch,
  update-sourcedeps no longer works and has been removed.
  This is because the source-dependencies files are no longer
  generated for download.  All support for source-dependencies
  files will be removed in Lenny.  All packages must now
  provide Source-Depends[-Indep] in their debian/control file.


NOTE: sbuild must be run in the directory that has the
chroot-{stable,testing,unstable} symlink or it won't find
the chroot and will build in base.  When using schroot,
a chroot with the same name (or alias) as the distribution
must be available.
