sbuild (0.54) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support for manual source dependencies has been removed.  Packages
    must now supply all their build dependencies in the debian/control
    file in the source package.  This should now be the case for all
    packages in the archive.

  * Support for sudo has been removed.  schroot is now required to access
    build chroots.  This change has been effected in order to improve the
    safety and security of sbuild, which no longer requires unrestricted
    sudo access to the host system.  Guidance for migrating to a schroot
    setup is provided in error messages and in sbuild-setup(7).  Also see
    schroot(1) and schroot.conf(5) for help configuring schroot.

  * Support for building outside a chroot on the host system has been
    removed, as has the corresponding $chroot_only option.  Building on
    the host system was rather dangerous, and also made the code far more
    complex than needed.  All building must now take place inside a chroot
    managed by schroot.

  * Support for building an unpacked source directory has been removed,
    because the .dsc needs to be available in the current working
    directory and copied into the chroot, or downloaded inside the chroot.

  * Several configuration options have been removed.  sbuild will print a
    diagnostic error message and exit with an error when obsolete options
    are used.

  * The default for $build_mode has been changed from "buildd" to "user".
    The means that sbuild will return a nonzero exit status on build
    failure.
