    script, recommend searchscripts instead of suggest
  * add a note to README.Debian and the man page that sbuild must be

 -- Rick Younie <younie@debian.org>  Sat, 14 Sep 2002 19:38:16 -0700

  * added a note that the original tarball has to be in the sbuild work
    directory $CHROOT/build/<user> for an "sbuild --source" build
  * removed the old potato chroot description; it can be gotten from the

sbuild (0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * split ref-testing from ref-unstable instead of symlink as they
    differ now
  * unstable dpkg --root is broken currently so use ppack instead of
    dpkg for checkchroot
  * don't 'touch' downloaded source; in buildd context, buildd-watcher
    should use ctime not mtime to look for old files
  * add a blurb about using chrapt to finish off the chroot build, in
    case debootstrap doesn't quite get it right

 -- Rick Younie <younie@debian.org>  Sat, 20 Jul 2002 06:26:05 -0700

  * Closes #120309 (the ITP)
