# This is a configuration file for /etc/init.d/buildd; it allows you
# to perform common modifications to the behavior of buildd
# initialization without editing the init script (and thus getting
# prompted by dpkg on upgrades).  Note that the defaults defined here
# are not used when invoking the buildd command; to configure buildd
# behaviour have a look at /etc/buildd/* and the buildd manual page
# ("man buildd").
