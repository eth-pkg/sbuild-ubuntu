Description: Tool for building Debian binary packages from Debian sources
 The sbuild suite of programs -- consisting of wanna-build, buildd and
 sbuild -- written by Roman Hodek and used by most architectures to
 build binary packages from source packages.  buildd schedules work
 from information it gets from the wanna-build database; sbuild does
 the grunt-work.
 .
 This package contains the core library modules used by these
 programs.

Description: Tool for building Debian binary packages from Debian sources
 sbuild is part of a suite of programs -- consisting of

 used by most architectures to build binary packages from source
 packages.  buildd schedules work from information it gets from
 the wanna-build database; sbuild does the grunt-work.
 .
 sbuild can do its work in chroots so both stable and unstable
 environments can be used on the same machine.  Useful for, say,
 building the latest unstable packages against stable library
 versions.  And by keeping only essential and build-essential
 in the chroots, you can find the correct build dependencies for
 a package.
