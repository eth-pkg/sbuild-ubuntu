Description: Tool for building Debian binary packages from Debian sources
 The sbuild suite of programs (wanna-build, buildd and sbuild) are
 used to build binary packages from source packages.  The wanna-build
 database tracks packages which require building; buildd schedules
 work from information it gets from the wanna-build database; sbuild
 does the actual package building.
 .
 This package contains the core library modules used by these
 programs.

 .
 sbuild can do its work in chroots so both stable and unstable
 environments can be used on the same machine.  Useful for, say,
 building the latest unstable packages against stable library
 versions.  And by keeping only essential and build-essential
 in the chroots, you can find the correct build dependencies for
 a package.

Description: Daemon for automatically building Debian binary packages from Debian sources
 The sbuild suite of programs (wanna-build, buildd and sbuild) are
 used to build binary packages from source packages.  The wanna-build
 database tracks packages which require building; buildd schedules
 work from information it gets from the wanna-build database; sbuild
 does the actual package building.
 .
 buildd is a daemon which will build Debian packages automatically
 using the wanna-build database to identify which packages need to
 be built.
