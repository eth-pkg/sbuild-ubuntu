sbuild (0.60.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * sbuild provides two build dependency resolvers, 'internal', which
    is the default, and currently used by the build dÃ¦mons, and
    'aptitude' which uses aptitude.

  * The 'aptitude' resolver has been available for nearly a year, and
    is believed to be ready for everyday use, having a number of
    advantages over the old 'internal' resolver.  We are soliciting
    feedback from users prior to making 'aptitude' the default.  To
    enable it, set "$build_dep_resolver='aptitude';" in your
    configuration.  Please report any discrepancies in its behaviour
    compared with the 'internal' resolver.  It is hoped that once it
    has been shown to work reliably and correctly, it will become the
    default resolver used on the buildd network; it is already in use
    on buildds autobuilding experimental.

  * The older 'internal' resolver is still used by the buildds, so
    packages intended for upload should use
    "$build_dep_resolver='internal';" to build using exactly the same
    dependencies that should be used by the buildds.
