The CVS at kullervo is close to the scripts in most common use
by the buildds except the CVS code still supports the older
FetchFile method of downloading source.  To check out kullervo
CVS:

  cvs -d :pserver:anon@cvs.linux-m68k.org:/CVS login
  [empty password]
  cvs -d :pserver:anon@cvs.linux-m68k.org:/CVS checkout wanna-build

This sbuild package was maintained by Rick Younie <younie@debian.org>.

Francesco P. Lovergine <frankie@debian.org> is the current maintainer.
