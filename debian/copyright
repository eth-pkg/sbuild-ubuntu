sbuild is maintained by the Debian buildd-tools project team.  It was
downloaded from git://git.debian.org/git/buildd-tools/sbuild.git.
Team information and mailing list are available at
http://alioth.debian.org/projects/buildd-tools/.

The upstream source was originally downloaded from the CVS repository
  :pserver:anon@cvs.linux-m68k.org:/CVS (module: wanna-build)
(up to version 0.36; September 2006), and the SVN repository
  http://svn.cyberhqz.com/svn/wanna-build
(version 0.37; January 2006 to November 2006).  All future changes are
in the buildd-tools GIT repository, with occasional merges from the
upstream SVN repository.

                  Ben Collins - the "apt patch" for sbuild for finding
