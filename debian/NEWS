sbuild (0.73.0-3) unstable; urgency=medium

    Generating a public/private keypair using "sbuild-update --keygen" for
    signing the sbuild internal dummy repository is now optional. You are only
    required to generate the keys if you plan to build packages for Debian
    Squeeze or older.

    If you only build packages for Debian Wheezy or newer, then
    /var/lib/sbuild/apt-keys/sbuild-key.sec and
    /var/lib/sbuild/apt-keys/sbuild-key.pub can be safely removed from
    your system.

sbuild (0.69.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    With this release, logically opposite boolean command line arguments cannot
    be specified together anymore. Attempting to do so will result in an error.

    The remaining changes in this version only concern users of sbuild external
    command hooks involving the %SBUILD_CHROOT_DIR percent escape in
    --pre-build-commands or --post-build-commands.

    With this release, the %SBUILD_CHROOT_DIR percent escape is now deprecated.
    It can still be used but it will only work for sbuild backends that work on
    the same file system as the sbuild process. With the addition of more
    backends like the autopkgtest backend sbuild is now able to build inside
    qemu virtual machines, containers and on remote hosts via ssh. In these
    cases the %SBUILD_CHROOT_DIR variable doesn't make sense anymore because
    the sbuild process cannot directly access the build environment anymore.

    Instead, the %SBUILD_CHROOT_EXEC percent escape can be used to run an
    arbitrary command inside the build chroot independent of the used backend.
    See the sbuild manual page of how to utilize %SBUILD_CHROOT_EXEC to even
    transfer files between the host running sbuild and the chroot backend.

sbuild (0.58.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

    The sbuild group was previously created as a non-sytem group.
    When upgrading from older versions of sbuild, the group will be
    deleted and re-created as a system group.

    Group membership will be transferred to the new group, and system
    files and directories owned by group sbuild will be updated to be
    owned by the new group.  Files and directories which are set to be
    owned by group sbuild on the system or inside any build chroots
    will need to be manually updated.  The group database inside any
    build chroots may also need updating.  If using schroot to access
    chroots, the group database should normally be updated
    automatically, as should file and directory ownership.

sbuild (0.58.0) unstable; urgency=low

    The configuration option @no_auto_upgrade, which was no longer
    used, has been removed.  To prevent packages being upgraded
    automatically, please use sbuild-hold.  See sbuild-hold(1).

    The configuration option $chroot_mode has been restored, allowing
    chroot access by both schroot (which remains the default) and
    sudo.

    A new configuration option $chroot_split has been added.  This
    allows both schroot and sudo chroot access to be modified to run
    apt/dpkg on the host system.  Note that schroot needs sudo to run
    commands as root on the host system.

    Deprecated commands from /usr/lib/sbuild have been removed.
    Please use the sbuild-* replacements found in /usr/bin.

    The maintainer name defaults to DEBEMAIL if set in the
    environment, so no longer needs setting explicitly in .sbuildrc.

    Unless configured as a buildd ($sbuild_mode), when using sudo
    chroot access, chroots are searched for in /etc/sbuild/chroots.
    This directory should contain symlinks to the chroots, with the
    distribution name being the name of the symlink.  Buildd mode will
    continue to use the old method of current-$distribution symlinks
    in the current directory.

    The log format used for build logs has been updated to use a more
    readable format, and is now encoded in UTF-8 rather than US-ASCII.
    Code which parses the log file may need to be updated to handle
    the new format.  Further log format changes made in the future.

    The wanna-build configuration has moved from
    /etc/wanna-build/wanna-build.conf into /etc/sbuild/sbuild.conf as
    part of ongoing refactoring work.  It is expected that this will
    be split into a separate file in the future once this work is
    completed.

    wanna-build can now correctly dump and restore its databases using
    the --export and --import options.  Note that wanna-build-catmldbm
    and related commands can not correctly dump the current database
    format, can not be used to restore the dump and will be removed in
    the future.

    The wanna-build commands do-merge-packages and do-merge-quinn
     have been renamed to wanna-build-merge-packages and
     wanna-build-merge-quinn.

sbuild (0.54) unstable; urgency=low


    Support for manual source dependencies has been removed.  Packages
    must now supply all their build dependencies in the debian/control
    file in the source package.  This should now be the case for all
    packages in the archive.

    Support for sudo has been removed.  schroot is now required to access
    build chroots.  This change has been effected in order to improve the
    safety and security of sbuild, which no longer requires unrestricted
    sudo access to the host system.  Guidance for migrating to a schroot
    setup is provided in error messages and in sbuild-setup(7).  Also see
    schroot(1) and schroot.conf(5) for help configuring schroot.

    Support for building outside a chroot on the host system has been
    removed, as has the corresponding $chroot_only option.  Building on
    the host system was rather dangerous, and also made the code far more
    complex than needed.  All building must now take place inside a chroot
    managed by schroot.

    Support for building an unpacked source directory has been removed,
    because the .dsc needs to be available in the current working
    directory and copied into the chroot, or downloaded inside the chroot.

    Several configuration options have been removed.  sbuild will print a
    diagnostic error message and exit with an error when obsolete options
    are used.

    The default for $build_mode has been changed from "buildd" to "user".
    The means that sbuild will return a nonzero exit status on build
    failure.
