.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsbuild\-createchroot\fR runs
.BR debootstrap (1)
to create a chroot suitable for building packages with sbuild.  Note that while
debootstrap may be used directly, sbuild\-createchroot performs additional
setup tasks such as adding additional packages and configuring various files in
the chroot.  Invoking sbuild\-createchroot is functionally equivalent to
running \f[CB]debootstrap\ \-\-variant=buildd
\-\-include=fakeroot,build\-essential\fP, then editing
\fI/etc/apt/sources.list\fP and \fI/etc/hosts\fP by hand.
.PP
The newly-created chroot is set up to work with
.BR schroot (1)
by creating a chroot definition file under \fI/etc/schroot/chroot.d\fP.  This
should be edited to finish the chroot configuration after
sbuild\-createchroot has completed.
.PP
\fBbuildd\-create\-chroot\fP, like \fBsbuild\-createchroot\fR, runs
.BR debootstrap (1)
to create a chroot for package building.  However, this creates a chroot
specifically for
.BR buildd (1)
with an additional mandatory option to specify a user who will be granted sudo
access inside the chroot.  This script mainly differs in its additional
customisation of \fI/etc/apt/sources.list\fP to use incoming.debian.org and
security-master.debian.org.  It also removes some packages from the
newly-created chroot.  Unless you are setting up an official Debian build
daemon, \fBsbuild\-createchroot\fP should be used instead.  The extra
functionality will be merged into \fBsbuild\-createchroot\fP in the future.

.SS Debootstrap options
Note that
.BR debootstrap (1)
is the canonical reference for the meaning of the options; they are passed
directly to debootstrap.
.TP
.BR \-\-arch=\fIarch\fP
Set the target architecture.  This may be used if dpkg is not already
installed.  See also \fI\-\-foreign\fP, below.
.TP
.BR \-\-chroot-suffix=\fIsuffix\fP
Add a custom suffix to the chroot name. Defaults to '\-sbuild'.
.TP
.BR \-\-chroot\-prefix=\fIprefix\fP
Add a custom prefix to the chroot name. Defaults to SUITE.  This is useful to
create variants of a base suite like stretch-backports to which the backports
archive can be manually added after the base chroot was created using
sbuild-shell. This way, a normal stretch chroot and a stretch-backports chroot
can exist side-by-side.  Besides this common use case, this functionality can
also be used to create chroots with any other type of customization. It is a
shortcut for creating a base chroot and then having to manually copy it and
edit the configuration files.
.TP
.BR \-\-chroot-mode=\fIschroot|sudo|unshare\fP
The sbuild chroot backend to generate the chroot for. The autopkgtest backend
is not supported by this method because of the diversity of container types it
supports. To generate a chroot for schroot and sudo, sbuild-createchroot must
be executed with superuser privileges (for example by using sudo). Because of
backwards compatibility, choosing schroot implies sudo (but not the other way
round). Choosing unshare requires the \fI\-\-make\-sbuild\-tarball\fP option.
Creating a chroot for the unshare backend can be done by a normal user (without
sudo) but it requires Linux user namespaces to be enabled (via "sysctl -w
kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1"). Chroot tarballs created for the unshare
backend are also compatible with the schroot backend if a respective schroot
config file is manually created by the user or by running sbuild-createchroot
with the  \fI--setup-only\fP option. Defaults to 'schroot'.
.TP
.BR \-\-foreign
Only perform the initial unpack phase of bootstrapping.  This is required if
the target and host architectures do not match.  Note that debootstrap requires
running by hand to complete installation; run the debootstrap
\fI/debootstrap/debootstrap\fP installed in \fITARGET-DIRECTORY\fP to complete
the installation.
.TP
.BR \-\-resolve-deps
Automatically resolve missing dependencies.  This is the default.
.TP
.BR \-\-no-resolve-deps
Do not automatically resolve missing dependencies.
.TP
.BR \-\-keep-debootstrap-dir
Don't delete the \fI/debootstrap\fP directory in \fITARGET-DIRECTORY\fP after
completing the installation.
.TP
.BR \-\-debootstrap=\fIdebootstrap\fP
Define a custom debootstrap variant. Defaults to 'debootstrap'.
.TP
.BR "\-\-include=\fIpackage1[,package2,[packagen]]\fP"
Comma separated list of packages which will be added to the list of packages to
download and extract.
.TP
.BR "\-\-exclude=\fIpackage1[,package2,[packagen]]\fP"
Comma separated list of packages which will be removed from the list of
packages to download and extract. Note that this can remove essential packages,
so use with extreme care.
.TP
.BR "\-\-components=\fIcomponent1[,component2,[componentn]]\fP"
Comma separated list of archive components to use (e.g. \[oq]main\[cq],
\[oq]contrib\[cq], \[oq]non-free\[cq]).  Defaults to \[oq]main\[cq].
.TP
.BR "\-\-keyring=\fIkeyring-file\fP"
Download signatures for retrieved \fIRelease\fP files and check them against
\fIkeyring-file\fP.  By default \fI/etc/apt/trusted.gpg\fP is used.  Set to an
empty string to disable signature checking.
.TP
.B SUITE
The distribution to bootstrap (e.g. \[oq]stretch[cq], \[oq]buster\[cq],
\[oq]bullseye\[cq], \[oq]sid\[cq]).  A complete list may be found in
\fI/usr/share/debootstrap/scripts\fP.
.TP
.B TARGET-DIRECTORY
The directory to create the chroot in.  The directory will be created if it
does not already exist.
.TP
.B DEBIAN-MIRROR-URI
An \f[CR]http://\fP, \f[CR]file:///\fP, or \f[CR]ssh:///\fP URI
pointing to a suitable archive mirror. Defaults to http://deb.debian.org/debian.
.TP
.B SCRIPT
debootstrap script to run.  Not typically required.
.SS sbuild\-createchroot behaviour
.TP
.BR "\-\-setup\-only"
Don't run debootstrap.  Only perform the setup tasks on an already existing
chroot.  This is useful for converting an existing chroot for use with sbuild
which has already been created using a tool such as debootstrap.
Some configuration steps can only be carried out on a directory chroot and
thus, this option is not useful with the unshare backend.
.TP
.BR \-\-make\-sbuild\-tarball=\fIfile\fP
Create a bootstrapped file type chroot ready for use with sbuild and save it as
\fIfile\fP. The compression format used for the tarball is dependent on the file
extension used in \fIfile\fP. See the \fBTARBALL FILE\fP section for more
details.
.TP
.BR \-\-keep\-sbuild\-chroot\-dir
Don't delete the directory used for creating a file type chroot. This option
does nothing if not creating a file type chroot.
.TP
.BR \-\-no\-deb\-src
Don't add a deb-src line to the \fI/etc/apt/sources.list\fP file in the
\fITARGET-DIRECTORY\fP after the debootstrap process. This is useful in
situation when it is known that sbuild will never have to download the source
package itself but is always given an already downloaded dsc. In that case,
this option will help to save bandwidth and disk space because the source
indices don't have to be downloaded and later continually updated.
.TP
.BR \-\-alias=\fIalias\fP
Add an alternative name that the chroot will be known by. This option can be
given multiple times to add more than one alias. Using an alias is useful for
chroots of distributions that are known by more than one name. For example
Debian unstable is also known as sid. Additionally, sbuild chooses the
distribution by the latest changelog entry which could list \fIUNRELEASED\fP
for packages that the maintainer is currently working on. For Debian it thus
makes sense to add \fIUNRELEASED\fP as an alias for a Debian unstable chroot.
This option is only allowed when choosing \fI--chroot-mode=schroot\fP.
For similar functionality with \fI--chroot-mode=unshare\fP you can work with
symlinks.
See the EXAMPLES section for how to use this option in practice.
.TP
.BR \-\-extra\-repository=\fIspec\fP
Add a repository to the list of apt sources. The repository specification is a
line suitable for an apt
.BR sources.list (5)
file. For instance, you might use
.nh
.B \-\-extra\-repository="deb http://deb.debian.org/debian experimental main"
.hy
to allow packages in the experimental distribution to fulfill
build-dependencies. Note that the build chroot must already trust the key of
this repository. See the EXAMPLES section for how to combine this option with
--chroot-prefix and --alias.
.TP
.BR \-\-command\-prefix=\fIprefix\fP
Set the chroot \fIcommand-prefix\fP option as specified. A common use-case is
to specify eatmydata, thereby preventing all commands executed in the chroot
from syncing data to disk. This option is only allowed when choosing
\fI--chroot-mode=schroot\fP. See
.BR schroot.conf (5)
for more details.
.SH TARBALL FILE
When creating an sbuild tarball \fIfile\fP, the compression format used to
generate the tarball depends on the entension used in \fIfile\fP. Here is a
listing of the extensions that will be detected and what format the tarball will
be generated as.
.TP
.BR *.tar
Generates an uncompressed tarball.
.TP
.BR *.tar.gz|*.tgz
Generates a compressed tarball using gzip.
.TP
.BR *.tar.bz2|*.tbz
Generates a compressed tarball using bzip2.
.TP
.BR *.tar.lz|*.tlz
Generates a compressed tarball using lzip.
.TP
.BR *.tar.xz|*.txz
Generates a compressed tarball using xz.
.PP
If no extension is specified, sbuild\-createchroot will rename \fIfile\fP to
\fIfile.tar.gz\fP and generate \fIfile.tar.gz\fP as a compressed tarball using gzip.
.SH EXAMPLES
To create a bootstrapped file type sid (unstable) chroot ready for use with
sbuild and schroot (the default backend), saved in
\fI/srv/chroot/unstable-amd64.tar.gz\fP using the
\fIdeb.debian.org\fP Debian http mirror redirector service and using a
temporary directory as the target:
.PP
\f[CR]% \f[CB]sudo sbuild\-createchroot \fP\fP\\
.br
    \-\-make\-sbuild\-tarball=/srv/chroot/unstable-amd64.tar.gz \fP\fP\\
.br
    sid `mktemp \-d` \fP\fP\\
.br
\f[CB]    http://deb.debian.org/debian\fP\[CR]
.PP
To create a plain type sid (unstable) schroot chroot in
\fI/srv/chroot/unstable\fP using the \fIdeb.debian.org\fP Debian http
mirror redirector service and with aliases for \fIunstable\fP and
\fIUNRELEASED\fP:
.PP
\f[CR]% \f[CB]sudo sbuild\-createchroot sid /srv/chroot/unstable-amd64 \fP\fP\\
.br
    \-\-alias=unstable \-\-alias=UNRELEASED \fP\fP\\
.br
\f[CB]    http://deb.debian.org/debian\fP\[CR]
.PP
To create a schroot chroot to build for stretch backports:
.PP
\f[CR]% \f[CB]sudo sbuild\-createchroot \fP\fP\\
.br
    \-\-extra\-repository="deb http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main" \fP\fP\\
.br
    \-\-chroot-prefix=stretch-backports \fP\fP\\
.br
    stretch /srv/chroot/stretch-backports-amd64 \fP\fP\\
.br
\f[CB]    http://deb.debian.org/debian\fP\[CR]
.PP
To create a schroot chroot to build for experimental using a custom chroot prefix:
.PP
\f[CR]% \f[CB]sudo sbuild\-createchroot \fP\fP\\
.br
    \-\-extra\-repository="deb http://deb.debian.org/debian experimental main" \fP\fP\\
.br
    \-\-chroot-prefix=experimental \fP\fP\\
.br
    unstable /srv/chroot/unstable-experimental-amd64 \fP\fP\\
.br
\f[CB]    http://deb.debian.org/debian\fP\[CR]
.PP
Creating a chroot for the unshare backend does not require superuser privileges
(no sudo). The path for the tarball is the default path expected by sbuild for
the unshare backend:
.PP
\f[CR]% \f[CB]sbuild-createchroot --chroot-mode=unshare \\
.br
    --make-sbuild-tarball ~/.cache/sbuild/unstable-amd64.tar.gz \\
.br
    sid `mktemp -d` http://deb.debian.org/debian/ \\
.PP
.SH HISTORY
sbuild\-createchroot was previously known as \fBbuildd.chroot\fP.
buildd.chroot performed exactly the same tasks, but additionally created a
number of directories in the chroot for use by sbuild.  This is now done by
.BR schroot (1).
