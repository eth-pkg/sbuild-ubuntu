.SH VERSION
This man page documents the packaged version of wanna\-build.  This version
is maintained by the \fBbuildd-tools\fP project developers on Alioth
(\f[CR]https://alioth.debian.org/projects/buildd\-tools/\fP).
.PP
There is also a version maintained by Ryan Murray which is adapted to build
daemon needs, with similar functionality.  This version should be equally
capable of working in a buildd setup, but has a number of enhancements aimed at
making it suitable for use by end-users.
.SH DESCRIPTION
wanna\-build\-catdb is used to make a raw text dump of a wanna\-build database.
wanna\-build\-catdb will dump databases in Berkely DB format, while
wanna\-build\-catgdbm will dump GDBM format databases and
wanna\-build\-catmldbm will dump MLDBM format databases.  MLDBM is the database
format currently used by wanna\-build.
.PP
wanna\-build\-catdb is deprecated.  It will not dump the complete multi-level
hash structure of current databases, and will be removed in the future.
wanna\-build
provides \-\-export and \-\-import options to dump and restore its database as
a text file.  Please use these instead of wanna\-build\-catdb.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I database
The database file to dump.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I /var/lib/wanna\-build
Database files.
