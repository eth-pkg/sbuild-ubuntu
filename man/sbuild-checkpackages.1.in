.TH SBUILD\-CHECKPACKAGES 1 "\*[RELEASE_DATE]" "Version \*[VERSION]" "Debian sbuild"
.SH NAME
sbuild\-checkpackages \- check the package list in a sbuild chroot against a reference list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR sbuild\-checkpackages
.RB [ \-h \[or] \-\-help " \[or] " \-V \[or] \-\-version

.B CHROOT
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsbuild\-checkpackages\fR compares the package list in an sbuild chroot (dpkg
status file) against a reference list of packages.  The differences between the
two lists are displayed, showing the changes to remove and install in order to
return the chroot to match the reference list.
.PP
The reference list may be set from the dpkg status file; this must be done
initially in order to have a baseline reference for comparison.  The chroot
should only include \fBessential\fP and \fBbuild-essential\fP packages, plus
the extra packages that sbuild needs such as \fBfakeroot\fP.
