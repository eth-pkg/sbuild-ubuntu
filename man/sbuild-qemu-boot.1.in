.TH SBUILD\-QEMU\-BOOT "1" "\*[RELEASE_DATE]" "Version \*[VERSION]" "Debian sbuild"
.SH NAME
sbuild\-qemu\-boot \- Boot a VM using a QEMU image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sbuild\-qemu\-boot
.RB [ \-h ]
.RB [ \-\-read-write ]
.RB [ \-\-snapshot ]
.RB [ \-\-shared-dir ]
.RB [ \-\-arch=ARCH ]
.RB [ \-\-ram\-size=MiB ]
.RB [ \-\-cpus=CPUs ]
.RB [ \-\-noexec ]
.RB IMAGE
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsbuild\-qemu\-boot\fR boots a QEMU VM using \fBIMAGE\fR into a console. The
image is in read-only mode by default, as the goal is to support
experimentation.
.PP
The architecture is auto-guessed by stripping any file suffix and then
splitting the image name on dashes ``\-'', and finally by looking for a Debian
architecture name. \fIsid-amd64.img\fR, \fIamd64-temporary.image\fR or even
just \fIamd64\fR would all be assumed to be amd64 images, but not
\fIamd64.rebuild-tests.img\fR. If this guesses wrong, use the
\fB\-\-arch\fR option.
.PP
Note that you might need to invoke stty(1) within the VM to match your
host terminal's settings.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show this help message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-read-write\fR
Write changes back to the image, instead of using the image in read\-only mode.
.TP
\fB\-\-snapshot\fR
Create a snapshot of the image before changing it. Useful for
reproducibility purposes. Ignored if the image is not booted in read\-write
mode, which is the default.
.TP
\fB\-\-shared\-dir\fR
Share this directory on the host with the guest. This will only work when the
image was created with sbuild-qemu-create(1).
.TP
\fB\-\-arch\fR=ARCH
Architecture to use (instead of attempting to auto\-guess).
.TP
\fB\-\-ram\-size\fR=MiB
VM memory size in MB. Default: 2048
.TP
\fB\-\-cpus\fR=CPUs
VM CPU count. Default: 2
.TP
\fB\-\-noexec\fR
Don't actually do anything. Just print the command string that
would be executed, and then exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
\fB$ sbuild\-qemu\-boot \-\-shared\-dir /tmp/foo unstable\-autopkgtest\-amd64.img\fR
.PP
This will update the image \fBunstable\-autopkgtest\-amd64.img\fR in
the current directory. If no such file exists there, then 
\fB$IMAGEDIR/unstable\-autopkgtest\-amd64.img\fR is tried.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
If \fB$IMAGEDIR\fR is unset, then \fI~/.cache/sbuild\fR is used.
