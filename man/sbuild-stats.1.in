.TH SBUILD\-STATS 1 "@RELEASE_DATE@" "Version @VERSION@" "Debian sbuild"
.SH NAME
sbuild\-stats \- display or alter database of package build times/space
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sbuild\-stats
.B avg\-pkg\-build\-time
.B avg\-pkg\-build\-space
[\-s/\-\-space] [\-a/\-\-add <package name> <time>] [\-\-delete <package name>] [\-\-dump] [\-t/\-\-top]
.SH VERSION
This man page documents the packaged version of sbuild.  This version is
maintained by the \fBbuildd-tools\fP project developers on Alioth
(\f[CR]https://alioth.debian.org/projects/buildd\-tools/\fP).
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsbuild\-stats\fR displays or alters data from a database of package build
times or space, usually updated by sbuild.  Note: sbuild\-stats was previously
known as avg\-pkg\-build\-time and avg\-pkg\-build\-space.  When invoked with
the old names, the database is defaulted to either the build-time or
build-space database, as if the \fI\-\-time\fP or \fI\-\-space\fP options had
been used, respectively.
.PP
If no option other than the database to use is given, \fBsbuild\-stats\fR will
display the entire contents of the database.
.PP
The database files are only used if they already exist.  See
\fIREADME.Debian\fP for more information.
.PP
.SS OPTIONS
.TP

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables are used by \fBsbuild\-stats\fR:
.IP HOME
The home directory of the user.
.SH FILES
\fBsbuild\-stats\fR reads the sbuild configuration files
\fI/etc/sbuild/sbuild.conf\fP and \fI~/.sbuildrc\fP (if it exists) to discover
the location of the databases, which are usually located under
\fI/var/lib/sbuild\fP.
.SH EXAMPLES
To view the average build time for the \fIkoffice\fP package:
.PP
\f[CR]% \f[CB]sbuild-stats --time koffice\fP\fP
.br
koffice:                02:44:55 (1 entry, sigma 00:00:00)
.PP
To view the average build space for the \fIkoffice\fP package:
.PP
\f[CR]% \f[CB]sbuild-stats --space koffice\fP\fP
