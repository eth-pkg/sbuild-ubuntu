.TH BUILDD.CONF 5 "\*[RELEASE_DATE]" "Version \*[VERSION]" "Debian sbuild"
.SH NAME
buildd.conf \- configuration file for buildd
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbuildd.conf\fR is a Perl script which is sourced by buildd to permit
configuration.  It is run in a sandbox and restricted to setting a small number
of variables, detailed below, which may be set to configure the behaviour of
buildd.  Each variable has an internal name, shown in all caps, and a perl
variable showing the default setting.  Note that the internal name is not
accessible within buildd.conf; only the variable may be assigned.  Also note
that some of the defaults are set to be unique for each build, and so some of
the defaults shown here are unique to the user and system used to build sbuild,
and will be different for your system.
.PP
While buildd permits many aspects of its behaviour to be configured, this
should not normally be required.  The defaults should be adequate for most
uses, and should only be changed if you are doing something more advanced, or
have specialist requirements.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.so buildd.conf.man
.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/buildd/buildd.conf
Configuration, maintained by the system administrator.  This may be used to
override the defaults.
.TP
.I ~/.builddrc
User-specific configuration.
