.SH NAME
sbuild\-qemu\-update \- sbuild\-update analog for QEMU images
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sbuild\-qemu\-update
.RB [ \-h ]
.RB [ \-\-snapshot ]
.RB [ \-\-arch=ARCH ]
.RB [ \-\-noexec ]
.RB image
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsbuild\-qemu\-update\fR boots a QEMU VM using \fIimage\fR and then runs
\fBapt-get\fR in it, performing \fBupdate\fR, \fBdist-upgrade\fR, \fBclean\fR
and \fBautoremove\fR. It can optionally create a snapshot before updating.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show this help message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-snapshot\fR
Create a snapshot of the image before updating it. Useful for
reproducibility purposes.
.TP
\fB\-\-arch\fR=ARCH
Architecture to use (instead of attempting to auto\-guess based on the image
name).
.TP
\fB\-\-noexec\fR
Don't actually do anything. Just print the command string that
would be executed, and then exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
\fB$ sbuild\-qemu\-update unstable\-autopkgtest\-amd64.img\fR
.PP
This will update the image \fBunstable\-autopkgtest\-amd64.img\fR in
the current directory. If no such file exists there, then 
\fB$IMAGEDIR/unstable\-autopkgtest\-amd64.img\fR is tried.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
If \fB$IMAGEDIR\fR is unset, then \fI~/.cache/sbuild\fR is used.
