.TH SBUILD\-QEMU\-UPDATE "1" "\*[RELEASE_DATE]" "Version \*[VERSION]" "Debian sbuild"
.SH NAME
sbuild\-qemu\-update \- sbuild\-update analog for QEMU images
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sbuild\-qemu\-update
.RB [ \-h ]
.RB [ \-\-snapshot ]
.RB [ \-\-arch=ARCH ]
.RB [ \-\-noexec ]
.RB IMAGE
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsbuild\-qemu\-update\fR boots a QEMU VM using \fBIMAGE\fR and then runs
\fBapt-get\fR in it, performing \fBupdate\fR, \fBdist-upgrade\fR, \fBclean\fR
and \fBautoremove\fR. It can optionally create a snapshot before updating.
.PP
The architecture is auto-guessed by stripping any file suffix and then
splitting the image name on dashes ``\-'', and finally by looking for a Debian
architecture name. \fIsid-amd64.img\fR, \fIamd64-temporary.image\fR or even
just \fIamd64\fR would all be assumed to be amd64 images, but not
\fIamd64.rebuild-tests.img\fR. If this guesses wrong, use the
\fB\-\-arch\fR option.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show this help message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-snapshot\fR
Create a snapshot of the image before changing it. Useful for
reproducibility purposes.
.TP
\fB\-\-arch\fR=ARCH
Architecture to use (instead of attempting to auto\-guess).
.TP
\fB\-\-timeout\fR=SECS
Maximum time to wait for command to finish with expected result. Mostly
relevant for foreign architectures, where \fBapt-get update\fR can take
quite a while. Default: 600s.
.TP
\fB\-\-noexec\fR
Don't actually do anything. Just print the command string that
would be executed, and then exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-boot\fR=auto,bios,efi,ieee1275,none
How to boot the image. Default is BIOS on amd64 and i386, EFI on arm64 and
armhf, and IEEE1275 on ppc64el.
.SH EXAMPLES
\fB$ sbuild\-qemu\-update unstable\-autopkgtest\-amd64.img\fR
.PP
This will update the image \fBunstable\-autopkgtest\-amd64.img\fR in
the current directory. If no such file exists there, then 
\fB$IMAGEDIR/unstable\-autopkgtest\-amd64.img\fR is tried.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
If \fB$IMAGEDIR\fR is unset, then \fI~/.cache/sbuild\fR is used.
