.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsbuild\-update\fR runs \f[CB]apt\-get\fP inside the specified chroot
performing \f[CB]update\fP, \f[CB]upgrade\fP, \f[CB]dist\-upgrade\fP,
\f[CB]clean\fP, \f[CB]autoclean\fP, and/or \f[CB]autoremove\fP depending on the
options specified on the command line.
.PP
\fBsbuild\-upgrade\fR, \fBsbuild\-distupgrade\fR, and \fBsbuild\-clean\fR, are
deprecated. They now simply run \fBsbuild\-update\fR with the appropriate
options (\f[CB]\-\-upgrade\fP or \f[CB]\-\-dist\-upgrade\fP for
\fBsbuild\-upgrade\fR or \fBsbuild\-distupgrade\fR respectively) along with
whatever arguments were passed in the scripts.

.BR \-k ", " \-\-keygen
Generate a GPG public/private key pair for self-signing local apt archives,
used for installation of dependency packages.  Note that this requires a
significant amount of entropy (randomness) and may hang on systems with poor
entropy sources, such as headless systems without direct user input.  In this
situation, it is advisable to create the key on a trusted local system, and
copy the files to the build system by hand from
\fI/var/lib/sbuild/apt-keys/\fP.
