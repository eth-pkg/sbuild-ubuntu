.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsbuild\fR rebuilds Debian binary packages from the corresponding Debian
source, installing any missing source dependencies.  The build takes place in a
dedicated clean build environment (chroot), rather than on the host system.
.PP
\fBsbuild\fR can fetch the Debian source over a network, or it can use
locally available sources.
.PP
sbuild is given a packages to process as the argument
\fBPACKAGE[.dsc]\fR.  This argument is in the form of either a
debianized package source directory, a source package name along with a
version in the form \fIpackage_version\fP, or a .dsc file. If no arguments are
given, the current working directory is passed as an argument.
.PP
For arguments given as source directories, dpkg-source is first run to produce a
source .dsc file. Then, the package is built using the .dsc produced. For
arguments in the form \fIpackage_version\fP, apt is used to download the source
package. For arguments given as a .dsc file, sbuild builds the source packages
directly. For .dsc files in remote locations, the source packages are downloaded
first, then built.
.PP
It is also possible to run external commands with sbuild. See the section
\fBEXTERNAL COMMANDS\fR for more on this.
.PP
\fBsbuild\fR mails the build logs to a user.  It is configured by the
configuration files \fI/etc/sbuild/sbuild.conf\fP and \fI~/.sbuildrc\fP.  An
example sbuildrc is available in
\fI/usr/share/doc/sbuild/examples/example.sbuildrc\fP.
A custom path to a configuration file can also be specified through setting the
\fBSBUILD_CONFIG\fP environment variable to the path of an additional
configuration file.
.PP
You can build either using a local package with its .dsc file or a
remote one by specifying an explicit dpkg version.
.PP
Note: When using schroot (recommended), the chroot having the name (or alias)
of the specified distribution will be used; schroot uses a chroot named
\fI$distribution\-$arch-sbuild\fP, \fI$distribution\-sbuild\fP,
\fI$distribution\-$arch\fP or \fI$distribution\fP, in that order of preference.
The \-c or \-\-chroot option may be used to override the chroot to be
used. When configured to use sudo (deprecated), sbuild will look for a symlink
to a chroot with the same name as the distribution specified.  sbuild will use
a symlink to the chroot located in \fI/etc/sbuild/chroot/$distribution\fP, or
must be run in a directory containing a \fIchroot\-$distribution\fP symlink to
the chroot (not recommended, but done for backward compatibility).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Display this manual.
.TP
.BR \-V ", " \-\-version
Print version information.
.TP
.BR "\-\-add\-depends=\fIdependency\fP"
.TP
.BR "\-\-add\-conflicts=\fIdependency\fP"
.TP
.BR "\-\-add\-depends\-arch=\fIdependency\fP"
.TP
.BR "\-\-add\-conflicts\-arch=\fIdependency\fP"
.TP
.BR "\-\-add\-depends\-indep=\fIdependency\fP"
.TP
.BR "\-\-add\-conflicts\-indep=\fIdependency\fP"
These options add a build dependencies to the source package being built, in
addition to the build dependency information specified in debian/control.
These dependencies will be concatenated directly to the Build-Depends,
Build-Conflicts, Build-Depends-Arch, Build-Conflicts-Arch, Build-Depends-Indep
and Build-Conflicts-Indep dependencies, respectively.  The options may be used
any number of times to add multiple dependencies.  The format is identical to
the format used in debian/control.
.TP
.BR "\-\-arch=\fIarchitecture\fP"
Build using the architecture specified.  A chroot named
\fI$distribution\-$arch-sbuild\fP or \fI$distribution\-arch\fP is searched for,
in that order of preference.  The chroot must be installed and configured
appropriately to build as that architecture, e.g. using
\fIpersonality=linux32\fP to build i386 packages on an amd64 system.  Note that
this option is equivalent to "\-\-host=architecture \-\-build=architecture".
.TP
.BR "\-\-host=\fIarchitecture\fP"
Build using the host architecture specified.  If $host and $build don't match, a
chroot named \fI$distribution\-$build\-$host\-sbuild\fP or \fI$distribution\-$build\-$host\fP
is searched for, falling back to \fI$distribution\-$build\-sbuild\fP or
\fI$distribution\-$build\fP, in that order of preference.  This option is only
useful for cross-building when used together with \-\-build.
.TP
.BR "\-\-build=\fIarchitecture\fP"
Build using the build architecture specified.  This option is only useful for
cross-building when used together with \-\-host.  If \-\-build is not specified,
the default system architecture is assumed.
.TP
.BR \-A ", " "\-\-arch\-all"
Also build Architecture: all packages, i.e. use dpkg\-buildpackage \-b
instead of \-B.
.TP
.BR "\-\-no\-arch\-all"
Do not build Architecture: all packages, i.e. use dpkg\-buildpackage \-B
instead of \-b. This option is the opposite of \-\-arch\-all.
.TP
.BR "\-\-arch\-any"
Build Architecture: any packages. This is the default behavior.
.TP
.BR "\-\-no\-arch\-any"
Do not build Architecture: any packages. This option is the opposite
of \-\-arch\-any and only useful when used together with \-\-arch\-all
or \-\-source.
.TP
.BR "\-\-arch\-all\-only"
Only build Architecture:all packages, i.e. use dpkg-buildpackage \-A
instead of \-B.  The \-\-arch=\fIarchitecture\fP option can still be used to
specify the architecture used to build the package.
.TP
.BR \-b ", " "\-\-batch"
Operate in batchmode, i.e. write a build-progress file during execution
and files on shutdown to facilitate a clean restart.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " "\-\-chroot=\fIchroot\fP"
Use the specified chroot. If not specified, the default is the first of
\fI$distribution\-$arch\-sbuild\fP, \fI$distribution\-sbuild\fP,
\fI$distribution\-$arch\fP or \fI$distribution\fP that exists.
.TP
.BR \-d ", " "\-\-dist=\fIdistribution\fP"
Explicitly set the distribution for the package build. This will be selecting
the correct chroot to use and also sets the value of the Distribution field in
the created .changes file. Setting this option is necessary when giving sbuild
a .dsc file or a plain source package name to build. In the latter case it
specifies the distribution the source package is fetched from.
.TP
.BR \-\-archive=\fIarchive\fP
Communicate with specified archive.
.TP
.BR \-D ", " "\-\-debug"
Enable debug output.
.TP
.BR "\-\-apt\-clean"

overriding the default setting.
.TP
.BR "\-\-apt\-distupgrade"
.TQ
.BR "\-\-no\-apt\-distupgrade"

overriding the default setting.
.TP
.BR \-m ", " "\-\-maintainer=\fImaintainer\fP"
Specify the identity to use for GPG signing packages, and also used as the
maintainer for binary NMUs.  This does not normally require setting (it
defaults to the uploader).
.TP
.BR \-e ", " "\-\-uploader=\fIuploader\fP"
Passed to dpkg\-genchanges and is used to set the Changed\-by: field in
the .changes file(s).
.TP
.BR \-k ", " "\-\-keyid=\fIkey-id\fP"
Passed to dpkg\-genchanges and is used to set the key to sign the .changes
file(s).  Default is not using any key.
.TP
.BR \-j ", " "\-\-jobs=\fIn\fP"
Number of jobs to run simultaneously.  Passed through to dpkg\-buildpackage.
.TP
.BR \-\-debbuildopt=\fIoption\fP
Pass the specified option directly to dpkg\-buildpackage.
.TP
.BR \-\-debbuildopts=\fIoptions\fP
Pass the specified options directly to dpkg\-buildpackage.  The options should
be separated by spaces.  If any options contain spaces, use \-\-debbuildopt
instead.
.TP
.BR \-\-dpkg\-source\-opt=\fIoptions\fP
Pass the specified options directly to dpkg-source. This is only used when
creating a source package from a Debianized source directory.
.br
\fBNOTE:\fR The '\fI-b\fP' option will always be passed to dpkg-source.
.TP
.BR \-\-dpkg\-source\-opts=\fIoptions\fP
Extra options to be appended to existing options passed to dpkg-source.
.TP
.BR "\-\-mail\-log\-to=\fIemail-address\fP"
Send the build log to the specified email address.  This overrides the
\fI$mailto\fP configuration option.
.TP
.BR "\-\-mailfrom=\fIemail-address\fP"
Email address used as the sender address for build logs.  This overrides the
\fI$mailfrom\fP configuration option.
.TP
.BR \-n ", " "\-\-nolog"
Do not create a package log file in the \fI$log_dir\fP directory and no build
log file, but print everything to stdout. Also do not send any log mails.
.TP
.BR \-p ", " "\-\-purge=\fIpurge-mode\fP"
Convenience option to set \fIpurge-mode\fR for build directory, build
dependencies and session.
.TP
.BR \-\-profiles=\fIprofile[,...]\fP"
Specify the profile(s) we build, as a comma-separated list. Defaults to the
space separated list of profiles in the \fBDEB_BUILD_PROFILES\fP environment
variable.
.TP
.BR "\-\-purge\-build=\fIpurge-mode\fP"
\fIpurge-mode\fR determines if the build directory will be deleted after a
build. Possible values are \fBalways\fR (default), \fBnever\fR, and
\fBsuccessful\fR.
.TP
.BR "\-\-purge\-deps=\fIpurge-mode\fP"
\fIpurge-mode\fR determines if the build dependencies will be removed after a
build. Possible values are \fBalways\fR (default), \fBnever\fR, and
\fBsuccessful\fR.
.TP
.BR "\-\-purge\-session=\fIpurge-mode\fP"
Purge the schroot session following a build.  This is useful in conjunction
with the \fI\-\-purge\-build\fP and \fI\-\-purge\-deps\fP options when using
snapshot chroots, since by default the snapshot will be deleted.  Possible
values are \fBalways\fR (default), \fBnever\fR, and \fBsuccessful\fR.
.TP
.BR \-s ", " "\-\-source"
Also build source package, i.e. use dpkg\-buildpackage without \-B.
.TP
.BR "\-\-no-source"
Don't build source package, i.e. use dpkg\-buildpackage with \-B.  This option
is the opposite of \-\-source.
.TP
.BR "\-\-force\-orig\-source"
When used with in conjunction with \-s, this option forces the inclusion of the
orig.tar.gz file in the generated .changes file, even in cases where it would
not normally be included, i.e. use dpkg\-buildpackage \-sa.
.TP
.BR "\-\-use\-snapshot"
Installs the latest snapshot gcc compiler from the \fIgcc-snapshot\fP package,
and alters the build environment to use the snapshot compiler for the build.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " "\-\-verbose"
Be verbose, i.e. all information goes to stdout as well as to the log files.
.TP
.BR \-q ", " "\-\-quiet"
Be quiet.  This is the opposite of \-\-verbose.
.TP
.BR "\-\-make\-binNMU=\fIchangelog-entry\fP"
With this option, \fBsbuild\fR will create a new changelog entry in
debian/changelog of every package built. The version number will be in the
format for binary-only NMUs (see \-\-binNMU); the maintainer is set to the
maintainer name configured for \fBsbuild\fR. \fIchangelog-entry\fR will be used
as the changelog entry following \[lq]Binary-only non-maintainer upload for
ARCH -- no source changes\[rq]. Please note that the versions in the
\fIPACKAGE_VERSION[.dsc]\fR arguments still have to be the unmodified (non-NMU
ones) so that the sources can be found. The version number in log files and
mails will be modified by \fBsbuild\fR automatically.
.TP
.BR "\-\-binNMU=\fINMU-version\fP"
The version number of the binary NMU.  This should be used in conjunction with
\-\-make\-binNMU.  \fIversion\fP is a single number for the (+b\fIn\fR) format
used for binary NMUs.
.TP
.BR "\-\-append\-to\-version=\fIstring\fP"
This option is similar to \-\-make\-binNMU except that it allows the user to
specify an arbitrary string to be appended to the version number (immediately
before the '+' in the Debian revision if \-\-make\-binNMU is also provided).
.TP
.BR \-\-clean\-source
When executing sbuild from within an unpacked source tree, execute the
debian/rules clean target. This is the default and might require some of the
build dependencies installed on the host.
.TP
.BR \-\-no\-clean\-source
When executing sbuild from within an unpacked source tree, do not run the
debian/rules clean target before building the source package. Only set this if
you start from a clean checkout and you know what you are doing.
.TP
.BR \-\-run\-lintian
Run lintian after a successful build.
.TP
.BR \-\-no\-run\-lintian
Don't run lintian after a successful build.  If sbuild is configured to run
lintian by default, this option will prevent lintian being run.
.TP
.BR \-\-lintian\-opt=\fIoptions\fP
Run lintian with the specified options.
.TP
.BR \-\-lintian\-opts=\fIoptions\fP
Append extra options to existing options passed to lintian.
.TP
.BR \-\-run\-piuparts
Run piuparts after a successful build.
.TP
.BR \-\-no\-run\-piuparts

specified, piuparts will be launched via sudo.
.TP
.BR \-\-piuparts\-root\-args=\fIoptions\fP
Add arguments that are used to launch piuparts as root. If no arguments are
specified, piuparts will be launched via sudo.
.TP
.BR \-\-pre\-build\-commands=\fIstring\fP
This is the earliest external command which is run right after the chroot
session has been initialized and before anything else is done (like installing
the build dependencies). The command is run as root outside of the chroot. This
option can be used multiple times to add multiple commands. See the section
.BR "EXTERNAL COMMANDS"
for more information.
.TP
.BR \-\-chroot\-setup\-commands=\fIstring\fP
Run these commands after the chroot and variables have been setup but before
dependencies are installed. The command is run as root inside of the chroot.
This option can be used multiple times to add multiple commands. See the
section
.BR "EXTERNAL COMMANDS"
for more information.
.TP
.BR \-\-build\-deps\-failed\-commands=\fIstring\fP
These commands are run if installing the build dependencies has failed directly
after the failed attempt. The environment is intact, and the failure can be
investigated.  Especially %SBUILD_SHELL is useful here. The command is run as
root inside the chroot. This option can be used multiple times to add multiple
commands. See the section
.BR "EXTERNAL COMMANDS"
for more information.
.TP
.BR \-\-starting\-build\-commands=\fIstring\fP
Run these commands after dependencies are installed, just before the package
build with dpkg-buildpackage starts. The command is run as the (non-root) user
running sbuild inside the chroot. This option can be used multiple times to add
multiple commands. See the section
.BR "EXTERNAL COMMANDS"
for more information.
.TP
.BR \-\-finished\-build\-commands=\fIstring\fP
Run these commands immediately after the timed package build finishes.  The
command is run as the (non-root) user running sbuild inside the chroot.  This
option can be used multiple times to add multiple commands. See the section
.BR "EXTERNAL COMMANDS"
for more information.
.TP
.BR \-\-build\-failed\-commands=\fIstring\fP
These commands are run if dpkg-buildpackage has failed directly after the
failed attempt. The environment is intact, and the failure can be investigated.
Especially %SBUILD_SHELL is useful here. The command is run as the (non-root)
user running %sbuild inside the chroot. This option can be used multiple times
to add multiple commands. See the section
.BR "EXTERNAL COMMANDS"
for more information.
.TP
.BR \-\-chroot\-cleanup\-commands=\fIstring\fP
Run these commands when a chroot is cleaned up, before build directory is
purged.  The command is run as root inside the chroot. This option can be used
multiple times to add multiple commands. See the section
.BR "EXTERNAL COMMANDS"
for more information.
.TP
.BR \-\-post\-build\-commands=\fIstring\fP
Run this command after a successful build. The command is run as root outside
of the chroot. This option can be used multiple times to add multiple commands.
See the section
.BR "EXTERNAL COMMANDS"
for more information.
.TP
.BR \-\-anything\-failed\-commands=\fIstring\fP
Run these commands for all the \fI\-\-xxx\-failed\-commands\fP options.
Especially %SBUILD_SHELL is useful here. This option can be used multiple times
to add multiple commands. See the section
.BR "EXTERNAL COMMANDS"
for more information.
.TP
.BR \-\-log\-external\-command\-output
Write output from external commands to the build log.
.TP
.BR \-\-log\-external\-command\-error
Write error output from external commands to the build log.
.TP
.BR "\-\-setup\-hook=\fIhook-script\fP" " " \fBDEPRECATED\fP
This option is deprecated. Use of this option will add \fIhook-script\fP to the
external commands to run via \fIchroot-setup-commands\fP.
.TP
.BR "\-\-build\-dep\-resolver=\fIresolver\fP"
Use the specified resolver to handle selecting the build dependencies.
Supported resolvers are \fIapt\fP (the default), \fIaptitude\fP, \fIaspcud\fP and \fIxapt\fP.
The apt resolver is the most appropriate resolver for most users, for building
for unstable, stable and other distributions.  If alternative build
dependencies are used (excluding architecture restrictions), only the first
alternative will be used; the others will be ignored.  The aptitude resolver is
very similar, but smarter and slower, and it will consider all alternatives by
default; it is suited to more complex situations, such as building packages for
the experimental distribution, where packages need installing from multiple
suites (\fIunstable\fP and \fIexperimental\fP).  Due to performance and other
issues (bug #139615), aptitude is not recommended for use by default.
If the dependency situation is so complex that neither apt nor aptitude are
able to find a solution, then you can use the aspcud resolver. This resolver
uses apt-cudf to ask aspcud, a real SAT solver, for a solution to the
installation problem. Since aspcud is a real SAT solver it will always find
a solution if one exists.
The xapt
resolver is intended only for cross-building, and is a temporary transitional
feature which will be removed following the complete introduction of multi-arch
support.
.TP
.BR \-\-resolve\-alternatives
Allow the use of alternatives in Build-Depends, Build-Depends-Arch and
Build-Depends-Indep.  This is the default for the aptitude dependency resolver.
.TP
.BR \-\-no\-resolve\-alternatives
Do not allow the use of alternatives in Build-Depends, Build-Depends-Arch and
Build-Depends-Indep.  Note that alternatives for the same package
(e.g. different versions) are still allowed.  This is the default for the
apt and xapt dependency resolvers.
.TP
.BR \-\-extra\-package=\fIpackage.deb\fP
Make \fIpackage.deb\fP available for build-dependency resolution, by
adding it to a temporary archive created by sbuild.  This makes it
easier to build packages against locally-built build depenencies,
without waiting for those packages to enter the main archive, or going
through the hassle of maintaining a local archive and making it
accessible inside the chroot.  \fIpackage.deb\fP is copied into the
chroot, so it can refer to any path on the host system.
.TP
.BR \-\-extra\-repository=\fIspec\fP
Add a repository to the list of apt sources during the package build.
The repository specification is a line suitable for an apt
.BR sources.list (5)
file. For instance, you might use
.nh
.B \-\-extra\-repository="deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian experimental main"
.hy
to allow packages in the experimental distribution to fulfill
build-dependencies. Note that the build chroot must already trust the
key of this repository or a key must be given with the
.nh
.B \-\-extra\-repository-key
.hy
flag. (see
.BR apt-secure (8))
.TP
.BR \-\-extra\-repository-key=\fIfile.asc\fP
Add \fIfile.asc\fP to the list of trusted keys inside the chroot. The key is
read from the filename given, and added to the trusted keys. For more
information, see
.BR apt-secure (8).
This flag is particularly useful if the target in
.nh
.B --extra-repository
.hy
is not signed
with a key that's trusted by the base chroot.
.TP
.BR \-\-build\-path=\fIstring\fP
By default the package is built in a path of the following format /build/packagename-XXXXXX/packagename-version/ where XXXXXX is a random ascii string. This option allows one to specify a custom path where the package is built inside the chroot. Notice that the sbuild user in the chroot must have permissions to create the path. Common writable locations are subdirectories of /tmp or /build. The buildpath must be an empty directory because the last component of the path will be removed after the build is finished. If you are running multiple sbuild instances with the same build path in parallel for the same package, make sure that your build path is not in a directory commonly mounted by all sbuild instances (like /tmp or /home). In that case, use for example /build instead. Otherwise, your builds will probably fail or contain wrong content.
.TP
.BR \-\-sbuild-mode=\fImode\fP
Behaviour changes for use in a buildd environment.  This overrides the
\fI$sbuild_mode\fP configuration option.
.SH EXTERNAL COMMANDS
Support to run external commands during an sbuild run is provided. A set of
external commands can be run at various stages of a build. Providing commands to
run is done through the appropriate options given on the command line and
through the use of the configuration files. In the configuration file, the list
of commands to run are placed in a hash of arrays of arrays of strings
corresponding to the commands to run.
.PP
There are several sets of commands. The \fIpre/post\-build\-\fP commands are
run external to the chroot. The \fIchroot\-setup/cleanup\-\fP commands and
\fIStarting/Finished\-Build\-\fP commands are run inside the chroot. They are
all run as root except the \fIStarting/Finishing\-build-\fP commands, which are
run as the current sbuild user. \fIbuild\-deps\-failed\fP runs similarly to
\fIchroot\-setup\fP: in the chroot as root. \fIbuild\-failed\fP runs similarly
to \fIfinished\-build\fP: in the chroot as the user.
.PP
Here is a summary of the ordering, user, internal/external to chroot for each
command hook
.PP
The following table shows each command hook in the context of the tasks sbuild
performs. The column \fIroot\fP shows whether the command is run as root (yes)
or not (no).  The column \fIchroot\fP shows whether the command is run inside
our outside the chroot. The remaining columns show the percent escapes that are
defined in each command. Percent escapes that are available in all commands
(\fB%%\fR, \fB%d\fR, \fB%a\fR, \fB%b\fR, \fB%p\fR, \fB%s\fR) are omitted.

The commands can be given in the configuration files. They can be given as
strings or as a list of arguments. For example, to run "foo" and "bar" with
arguments before a build starts, specifying the "foo" command as a list and
"bar" as a string, one could do this:
.PP
\f[CB]$external_commands = {\fP
.br
\f[CB]    "pre-build-commands" => [\fP
.br
\f[CB]        ['foo', 'arg1', 'arg2'],\fP
.br
\f[CB]        'bar arg1 arg2 arg3',\fP
.br
\f[CB]    ],
.br
\f[CB]};\fP
.PP
Hash keys for commands to run at other stages have the same name as their
corresponding command-line option name without the preceding '--'.
.PP
Here's an example of how to do the same with the previous example, except using
the \fI\-\-pre\-build\-commands\fP option.
.PP
\f[CB]$ sbuild \\\fP
.br
\f[CB]      \-\-pre\-build\-commands='foo arg1 arg2' \\\fP
.br
\f[CB]      \-\-pre\-build\-commands='bar arg1 arg2 arg3'\fP
.PP
Note that all these commands are executed through the shell in "/bin/sh". If
specifying the command as a list in the config file, very few shell facilities
are supported: no redirection, no command concatenation with ; and so on. When
passing a string (in the config file or on the commandline), the string is
passed as-is to the shell. So all shell facilities are available, given that
you escape everything properly, as you would in an interactive shell.
.PP
Besides running external commands, sbuild can also detect the use of certain
percent escapes given as arguments. These are used to allow for a command to be
supplied with a certain argument depending on the escape given.
For example, it could be possible to have an external command be given the
path to a .changes file.
.PP
Here is a listing of keywords and a description of what it's converted to.
.TP
\fB%%\fR
Used to escape a '\fI%\fP'.
.TP
\fB%d\fR, \fB%SBUILD_DSC\fR
These escapes are converted to the absolute path to a package's .dsc file.
.TP
\fB%c\fR, \fB%SBUILD_CHANGES\fR
These escapes are converted to the absolute path to a package's source .changes
file. This variable is only set after the build is finished, i.e in
\f[CB]\-\-chroot\-cleanup\-commands\fP and \f[CB]\-\-post\-build\-commands\fP.
.TP
\fB%a\fR, \fB%SBUILD_HOST_ARCH\fR
These escapes are converted to the debian name of the architecture the build 
is being built for (e.g amd64, armhf).
.TP
\fB%r\fR, \fB%SBUILD_CHROOT_DIR\fR
These escapes are converted to the absolute path on the host to the root
directory of the chroot. This variable is not set if the external command is
run inside the chroot. Thus this escape is only available for
\f[CB]\-\-pre\-build\-commands\fP and \f[CB]\-\-post\-build\-commands\fP.
.TP
\fB%b\fR, \fB%SBUILD_BUILD_DIR\fR
These escapes are converted to the absolute path to the build directory inside
the chroot.
.TP
\fB%p\fR, \fB%SBUILD_PKGBUILD_DIR\fR
These escapes are converted to the absolute path to the package build directory
inside the chroot.
.TP
\fB%s\fR, \fB%SBUILD_SHELL\fR
This is converted to a command to spawn an interactive "bash" shell
.PP
Percent escapes are only substituted when an appropriate value is defined for
them. At other times, it is left unchanged. In practice this means that there
are only two escapes that are not available in all external commands: \fB%c\fR
and \fB%r\fR. For example, a .changes file is only defined at the end of a
build, so using \fI%c\fR will only be substituted for post-build-commands.
.PP
Here's an example of using an escape to run a program foo on a .changes file
after a build is done.
.PP
\f[CB]$ sbuild \-\-post\-build\-commands \\\fP
.br
\f[CB]      'foo %SBUILD_CHANGES'\fP
.PP
And here's an example that will spawn an interactive shell to investigate the
problem whenever the build failed:
.PP
\f[CB]$ sbuild \-\-build\-failed\-commands '%s'\fP
.PP
One final note, external commands are processed in the order they are given.
Also, the commands given in a configuration file are processed first, then the
commands given through the command line options.
.SH LOCAL ARCHIVE
The apt and aptitude resolvers create a local archive for installing build
dependencies.  This is an internal implementation detail of the build
dependency resolver, which is not user configurable, and is intended to be
entirely transparent to the user.  The local archive exists only transiently
during the package build.  It does not persist across builds, and it is only
used to store the dummy dependency packages created for a single build.
.PP
The dependency resolvers do the following:
.IP \[bu]
Create a dummy dependency package.  This contains the Build-Depends (and
optionally Build-Depends-Arch and Build-Depends-Indep) as Depends, and
Build-Conflicts (and optionally Build-Conflicts-Arch and Build-Conflicts-Indep)
as Conflicts.
.IP \[bu]
Install the dummy dependency package into the local archive,
.IP \[bu]
Generate the \fIPackages\fP, \fISources\fP and \fIRelease\fP files.
.IP \[bu]
Write a \fIsources.list\fP file for the local archive into
\fI/etc/apt/sources.list.d\fP.
.IP \[bu]
Inject the lists directly into \fI/var/lib/apt/lists\fP.  This step is to save
running updating all apt sources which is undesirable during a build; apt and
aptitude do not support updating a single source at present.
.IP \[bu]
Regenerate the apt caches to ensure everything is in sync.
.IP \[bu]
Install the dummy dependency package with apt or aptitude; the dummy package is
pulled from the local apt archive, while all its dependencies are pulled from
the regular configured apt sources.
.PP
At the end of the build, the local archive is removed, along with the rest of
the build tree.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The following environment variables are used by \fBsbuild\fR:
.IP "HOME"
The home directory of the user.
.IP "LOGNAME"
Used in lockfiles.
.IP "SBUILD_CONFIG"
Path to an additional configuration file on top of the system wide and user
specific ones.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/sbuild/sbuild.conf
Configuration, maintained by the system administrator.  This may be used to
override the defaults.
.TP
.I /etc/sbuild/chroot
Directory containing symbolic links to chroots.  This is only used for sudo
chroot access; schroot access uses the schroot chroot configuration.
.TP
.I ~/.sbuildrc
User-specific configuration.
.TP
.I /var/lib/sbuild
Build trees, archive signing keys, build statistics and lock files.
