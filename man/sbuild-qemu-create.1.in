.TH SBUILD\-QEMU\-CREATE "1" "\*[RELEASE_DATE]" "Version \*[VERSION]" "Debian sbuild"
.SH NAME
sbuild\-qemu\-create \- QEMU image creator for sbuild
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sbuild\-qemu\-create
.RB [ \-h ]
.RB [ \-\-arch=ARCH ]
.RB [ \-\-install\-packages=INSTALL_PACKAGES]
.RB [ \-\-extra\-deb=EXTRA_DEB]
.RB [ \-\-components=COMPONENTS ]
.RB [ \-\-skel=SKEL ]
.RB [ \-\-authorized\-keys=FILE ]
.RB [ \-\-size=SIZE ]
.RB [ \-o=OUT_FILE  ]
.RB [ \-\-noexec ]
.RB [RELEASE]
.RB [MIRROR]
.PP
Build an image for use with \fBsbuild-qemu\fR and \fBautopkgtest\fR.
\fBRELEASE\fR will be debootstrapped from \fBMIRROR\fR. This mirror
will also be used for the \fIsources.list\fR file within the VM.
See MIRROR below.
.PP
Note that sbuild\-qemu\-create is just a simple wrapper around
autopkgtest\-build\-qemu(1) that automates a few additional steps commonly
performed for package\-building images.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show this help message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-arch\fR=ARCH
Architecture to use. Default is the host architecture. Currently supported
architectures are: amd64, arm64, armhf, i386, ppc64el.
.TP
\fB\-\-install\-packages\fR=INSTALL_PACKAGES
Comma\-separated list of additional packages to install using
\fBapt\-get install\fR from within the image.
.TP
\fB\-\-extra\-deb\fR=EXTRA_DEB
Package file (.deb) from the local filesystem to install. Can be specified more
than once.
.TP
\fB\-\-components\fR=COMPONENTS
Comma\-separated list of components to use with \fIsources.list\fR entries.
Default: main.
.TP
\fB\-\-skel\fR=SKEL
Skeleton directory to use for \fI\,/root\/\fP.
.TP
\fB\-\-authorized\-keys\fR=FILE
Install this file as \fI/root/.ssh/authorized_keys\fR within the guest. This
will automatically install the \fBopenssh-server\fR package. This supersedes
any copying of this file by the \-\-skel option.
.TP
\fB\-\-size\fR=SIZE
Image size to use. Note that the images will be created in qcow2 format, so
they won't consume that space right away. Default: 10G.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR=OUT_FILE, \fB\-\-out\-file\fR=OUT_FILE
Output filename. If not supplied, then DIST\-autopkgtest\-ARCH.img will be
used.
.TP
\fB\-\-noexec\fR
Don't actually do anything. Just print the autopkgtest\-build\-qemu(1) command
string that would be executed, and then exit.
.SH "MIRROR"
It is \fBhighly recommended\fR that you use an APT cache, like approx(8) or
apt\-cacher\-ng(8), on the \fBlocal\fR machine (so that the VM can access
that cache without much hassle) as a mirror. This will dramatically speed up the
package build process. On the author's local machine, installing the build
dependencies of even larger packages takes only a few seconds.
.PP
If you use a local cache, then ensure that the mirror is accessible from within
the guest. Using \fIhttp://localhost:9999/debian\fR or similar will
successfully build the image, but APT will fail within the running VM, because
to the VM, ``localhost'' is something else. An easy workaround is to use an
IP address instead, for example \fIhttp://192.168.0.123:9999/debian\fR,
assuming the host system has the IP 192.168.0.123.
.SH "SPECIAL CASES"
If \fBRELEASE\fR is \fBexperimental\fR, \fIsources.list\fR will contain
entries for both \fBexperimental\fR and \fBunstable\fR.
.PP
If \fBRELEASE\fR ends with \fB\-backports\fR, \fIsources.list\fR will contain
entries for both \fBRELEASE\fR and for the distribution it is based upon. In
other words, specifying \fIbullseye-backports\fR will also add an entry
for \fIbullseye\fR.
.SH "SHARING FILES"
Among other things, autopkgtest\-virt\-qemu(1) has built-in support for sharing
a directory on the host with the guest, so no further configuration should be
necessary when accessing the VM using autopkgtest.
.PP
In additon to that, a mount point for a 9p filesystem is added to the
VM's \fI/etc/fstab\fR. This is for cases where the VM is launched via QEMU
directly, rather than going through autopkgtest\-virt\-qemu.
.PP
To share a directory on the host with the VM, QEMU should be started with
the following additional options:
.PP
\fB \-virtfs local,path=/path/to/host/dir,id=sbuild-qemu,mount_tag=sbuild-qemu,security_model=none
.SH "TTY GEOMETRY"
sbuild\-qemu\-creates a file
\fI/etc/profile.d/sbuild\-qemu\-terminal\-settings.sh\fR within the VM. This file
reads terminal column and row geometry passed on through from the host, and
sets the geometry within the guest using stty(1).
.SH EXAMPLES
\fB$ sudo sbuild\-qemu\-create unstable http://deb.debian.org/debian\fR
.PP
This will create an image \fBunstable\-autopkgtest\-amd64.img\fR (assuming
that the host architecture is amd64) with the unstable distribution.
.PP
\fB$ sudo sbuild\-qemu\-create bullseye\-backports http://deb.debian.org/debian\fR
.PP
This will create an image \fBbullseye\-backports\-autopkgtest\-amd64.img\fR,
with \fIsources.list\fR entries for both bullseye and bullseye-backports.
.PP
\fB$ sudo sbuild\-qemu\-create \-\-skel DIR unstable http://deb.debian.org/debian\fR
.PP
The files in \fBDIR\fR will be copied into /root (that is, root's $HOME). This
can be used, for example, to copy an \fB.ssh/authorized_keys\fR file, so that
one can connect to the running image using SSH (assuming openssh\-server is
installed).
.PP
\fB$ sudo sbuild\-qemu\-create \-\-install\-packages openssh\-server unstable http://deb.debian.org/debian\fR
.PP
This would install openssh\-server. The package will be downloaded in the
target environment using 'apt-get'.
.PP
A popular package to pre\-install this way would be \fBdebhelper\fR, as it is a
build dependency of the vast majority of Debian packages.
.PP
\fB$ sudo sbuild\-qemu\-create \-\-extra\-deb FOO.deb unstable http://deb.debian.org/debian\fR
.PP
This would install the package \fBFOO.deb\fR from the local filesystem.
Useful, for example, to install additional keyring packages.
