Working on sbuild                                                   -*- text -*-
═════════════════

This document is a short guide to the conventions used in the
buildd-tools sbuild project.


Coding
──────

The style should be apparent from the source.  It is the default Emacs
perl-mode style.

Sbuild can be executed directly from source by running the following from the
top level directory.

    $ PERL5LIB=lib bin/sbuild


Documentation
─────────────

All the documentation is in UNIX manual page format.  GNU roff
extensions are permitted, as is use of tbl.  Make sure the printed
output is as good as terminal display.  Run "make ps" or "make pdf" to
build the printed documentation.


The following styles are used:

  Style                  Formatting                Syntax
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  New term               Bold                      .B or \fB
  Option definition      Bold, args in italic      .BR and \fI
  Option reference       Italic                    .I or \fI
  File definition        Bold italic               \f[BI]
  File reference         Italic                    .I or \fI
  Config key definition  Courier bold italic       \f[CBI]
  Config key reference   Courier italic            \f[CI]
  Values                 Single quotes             \[oq] and \[cq]
  Example text           Double quotes             \[lq] and \[rq]
  Cross references       Italics in double quotes  \[lq]\fI...\fP\[rq]
  Verbatim examples      Courier                   \f[CR]
  Verbatim user input    Courier bold              \f[CB]


Releasing
─────────

• The code must pass the testsuite (run 'sudo make check' after
  ./configure --enable-chroot-checks). This requires a local schroot
  called 'unstable' setup. These checks can take some time to
  run. Plain "autoreconf -fi && ./configure && make check" runs only the
  checks that can be done without schroot, which are very quick.
