Working on sbuild                                                   -*- text -*-
═════════════════

This document is a short guide to the conventions used in the
buildd-tools sbuild project.


Coding
──────

The style should be apparent from the source.  It is the default Emacs
perl-mode style.


Documentation
─────────────

All the documentation is in UNIX manual page format.  GNU roff
extensions are permitted, as is use of tbl.  Make sure the printed
output is as good as terminal display.  Run "make ps" or "make pdf" to
build the printed documentation.


The following styles are used:

  Style                  Formatting                Syntax
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  New term               Bold                      .B or \fB
  Option definition      Bold, args in italic      .BR and \fI
  Option reference       Italic                    .I or \fI
  File definition        Bold italic               \f[BI]
  File reference         Italic                    .I or \fI
  Config key definition  Courier bold italic       \f[CBI]
  Config key reference   Courier italic            \f[CI]
  Values                 Single quotes             \[oq] and \[cq]
  Example text           Double quotes             \[lq] and \[rq]
  Cross references       Italics in double quotes  \[lq]\fI...\fP\[rq]
  Verbatim examples      Courier                   \f[CR]
  Verbatim user input    Courier bold              \f[CB]


Releasing
─────────

New upstream releases:

• The code must pass the testsuite (make check).

• The NEWS file must be up to date, and have the current version
  number present on the line starting with "Welcome to sbuild
  <version>.".

• Run scripts/git-tag-release which will tag the git repository and
  prompt for a GPG passphrase to sign the tag with your GPG public
  key.  This is essential to get a correct version number in the
  release in the next step, and can not be skipped.

• Run ./bootstrap to create the VERSION file and regenerate the
  configure script with the new version number.  This uses the last
  release tag (generated with git-tag-release) to get the package name
  and version number.

• Run ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode and then "make distcheck"
  to test and package up the release

New Debian releases:

• Run debian/git-tag-debian to tag the release.
