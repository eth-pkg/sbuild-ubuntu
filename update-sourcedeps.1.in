.TH UPDATE\-SOURCEDEPS 1 "@DATE@" "Version @VERSION@" "Debian sbuild"
.SH NAME
update\-sourcedeps \- update the sbuild source dependency files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B update\-sourcedeps
.SH VERSION
This man page documents the packaged version of sbuild.  This version
is maintained by the \fBbuildd-tools\fP project developers on Alioth
(\f[CR]https://alioth.debian.org/projects/buildd\-tools/\fP).
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBupdate\-sourcedeps\fR updates the source\-dependencies\-* files
from \f[CR]buildd.debian.org/andrea/\fP.  These dependencies are used
by sbuild to calculate the Build-Depends for those packages that don't
include them\[em]mainly potato, and increasingly fewer woody,
packages.  \fBupdate\-sourcedeps\fR also contains arch-specific and
package-specific patches that are applied by sbuild after the source
is unpacked.  These patches work around temporary compiler bugs and
other transient problems so a package can still be autobuilt and the
change can be easily reverted without bothering the package
maintainer.
.PP
\fBupdate\-sourcedeps\fR is normally called by buildd.  Since sbuild
is used by itself here, \fBupdate\-sourcedeps\fR must to be called
manually (or not).  The source-dependencies-* files aren't required by
sbuild but are very helpful if you're autobuilding a lot of packages.
.SH NOTE
Before you file bugs for build failures be sure you understand the
difference between src-deps and build-deps and also how the src-dep
patches work.
.SH WARNING
Inappropriate settings in your \fI~/.wgetrc\fP can cause problems.
The WGETRC environment variable can be used to redirect \fI.wgetrc\fP.
