Build-essential and friends
===========================

sbuild-createchroot installs build-essentials so your working
environment should already be ok. You will only need to add a few more
packages in the chroot, using sbuild-apt. eg.

	sbuild-apt <chroot> apt-get install sudo fakeroot ssmtp

To show what needs to be added or removed from the unstable chroot you
can use:

	sbuild-checkpackages --list <chroot>

To add packages:

	sbuild-apt <chroot> apt-get install

or if you wish to remove packages:

	sbuild-apt <chroot> apt-get --purge remove


Alternatively, to enter the chroot and work inside it, use:

	sbuild-shell <chroot>


With these new tools buildd.chroot has been made obsolete.


Possible problems
=================

ssmtp won't install and debootstrap will fail if it can't
find the hostname.  /etc/hosts not copied over?

You may need to use the latest debootstrap.

You'll have to log in again for you to be in group sbuild.

debconf needs to be set noninteractive:
$ sbuild-shell <chroot> ( or "sudo chroot /your/chroot /bin/sh" )
$ dpkg-reconfigure -plow debconf
    1. Dialog  2. Readline  3. Gnome  4. Editor  5. Noninteractive
  What interface should be used for configuring packages? [1] 5
    1. critical  2. high  3. medium  4. low
  Ignore questions with a priority less than.. [3] 1
  Show all old questions again and again? [no] 

md5sum mismatch when building a source package (sbuild --source):
  - the original tarball has to be in the work directory -
    $CHROOT/build/<user> - for a sourceful build or a new
    orig.tar.gz will be created with an incorrect md5sum.

Apt Resolver Archive Keys
=========================

The default location for the archive keys used in the apt resolver is at
/var/lib/sbuild/apt-keys/sbuild-key.sec for the secret key and
/var/lib/sbuild/apt-keys/sbuild-key.pub for the public key. Sbuild will generate
these keys if either of these keys are missing at these locations. The keys are
generated using a parameter file with the following entries.

  Key-Type: RSA
  Key-Length: 1024
  Name-Real: Sbuild Signer
  Name-Comment: Sbuild Build Dependency Archive Key
  Name-Email: buildd-tools-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org
  Expire-Date: 0
  %secring /var/lib/sbuild/apt-keys/sbuild-key.sec
  %pubring /var/lib/sbuild/apt-keys/sbuild-key.pub
  %commit

Key generation requires entropy (usually gathered by keyboard/mouse movement).
For installations of sbuild on machines where entropy gathering is minimal (such
as a headless server), it is recommended the keys are generated by other means
and installed in the appropriate location as mentioned above.
