Build-essential and friends
===========================

sbuild-createchroot installs build-essentials so your working
environment should already be ok. You will need only to add a few more
packages in the chroot, using e.g.

sbuild-apt <chroot> apt-get install sudo fakeroot ssmtp

sbuild-checkchroot <chroot>
    shows what needs to be added to or deleted from the unstable
    chroot.  You can use

        sbuild-apt <chroot> apt-get install

    to add packages ("--purge remove: to delete them) or

        sbuild-shell <chroot>

    to enter the chroot and work inside it.

With the new flavor of buildd.chroot is basically obsolete.


Possible problems
=================

ssmtp won't install and debootstrap will fail if it can't
find the hostname.  /etc/hosts not copied over?

You may need to use the latest debootstrap.

You'll have to log in again for you to be in group sbuild.

debconf needs to be set noninteractive:
$ sbuild-shell <chroot> ( or "sudo chroot /your/chroot /bin/sh" )
$ dpkg-reconfigure -plow debconf
    1. Dialog  2. Readline  3. Gnome  4. Editor  5. Noninteractive
  What interface should be used for configuring packages? [1] 5
    1. critical  2. high  3. medium  4. low
  Ignore questions with a priority less than.. [3] 1
  Show all old questions again and again? [no] 

md5sum mismatch when building a source package (sbuild --source):
  - the original tarball has to be in the work directory,
    $CHROOT/build/<user>, for a sourceful build or a new
    orig.tar.gz will be created with an incorrect md5sum.
