.SH VERSION
This man page documents the packaged version of sbuild.  This version
is maintained by the \fBbuildd-tools\fP project developers on Alioth
(\f[CR]https://alioth.debian.org/projects/buildd\-tools/\fP).
.PP
There is also a version maintained by Ryan Murray which is adapted to build
daemon needs, with similar functionality.  This version should be equally
capable of working in a buildd setup, but has a number of enhancements aimed at
making it suitable for use by end-users.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsbuild\fR rebuilds Debian binary packages from the corresponding
Debian source.  It is similar to dbuild and debbuild, but, unlike
them, it knows about source dependencies.
.PP
\fBsbuild\fR can fetch the Debian source over a network, or it can use
locally available sources.
.PP
\fBsbuild\fR mails the build logs to a user.  It is configured by the
configuration files \fI/usr/share/sbuild/sbuild.conf\fP,
\fI/etc/sbuild/sbuild.conf\fP, and \fI~/.sbuildrc\fP.  An example
sbuildrc is available in
\fI/usr/share/doc/sbuild/examples/example.sbuildrc\fP.  \fBsbuild\fR
will \fBnot\fP run without a valid \fI~/.sbuildrc\fP.
.PP
Optionally, source dependencies are read from
\fI/var/lib/sbuild/source\-dependencies\-*\fP; see that file for more
information on source-dependencies.  Also see README.Debian.
.PP
You can build either using a local package with its .dsc file or a
remote one by specifying an explicit dpkg version.
.PP
Note: \fBsbuild\fR must be run in the directory (\fI~/build\fP by default) with
the chroot\-{stable,testing,unstable} symlink to the chroot or it will do the
build in the base install which is not what you want.  When using schroot,
these requirements do not apply; the chroot having the name (or alias) of the
specified distribution will be used; schroot uses a chroot named
\fI$distribution\-sbuild\fP, or \fI$distribution\fP, in that order of
preference.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.IR \-a , "\-\-add\-depends=<dependency-line>"
This option adds some source dependency information for a package. It can be
given more than one time with accumulating effect. The argument is a line of
source dependencies in the same format as in
\fI/var/lib/sbuild/source\-dependencies\fR. The given dependencies are appended
to the src-deps from source\-dependencies\-* files or package src-deps, resp.
.TP
.IR \-A , "\-\-arch\-all"
Also build Architecture: all packages, i.e. use dpkg\-buildpackage \-b
instead of \-B.
.TP
.IR \-b , "\-\-batch"
Operate in batchmode, i.e. write a build-progress file during execution
and files on shutdown to facilitate a clean restart.
.TP
.IR \-d , "\-\-distribution=<distribution>"
Fetch source packages from specified distribution.
.TP
.IR \-f , "\-\-force\-depends=<dependency-line>"
This option overrides source dependency information for a package. It
can be given more than one time with accumulating effect. The argument
is a line of source dependencies in the same format as in
\fI/var/lib/sbuild/source\-dependencies\fR.
.TP
.IR \-D , "\-\-debug"
Enable debug output.
.TP
.IR \-m , "\-\-maintainer=<maintainer>"
Passed to dpkg\-genchanges and is used to set the Maintainer: field in
the .changes file(s).
.TP
.IR \-e , "\-\-uploader=<maintainer>"
Passed to dpkg\-genchanges and is used to set the Changed\-by: field in
the .changes file(s).
.TP
.IR \-k , "\-\-keyid=<maintainer>"
Passed to dpkg\-genchanges and is used to set the key to sign the .changes
file(s).  Default is not using any key.
.TP
.IR \-n , "\-\-nolog"
Do not create a package log file in the $log_dir directory and no
build log file, but print everything to stdout. Also do not send any
log mails.
.TP
.IR \-p , "\-\-purge=<mode>"
\fImode\fR decides if to delete the build directory. Possible values
are \fBalways\fR, \fBnever\fR, and \fBsuccessful\fR.
.TP
.IR \-s , "\-\-source"
Also build source package, i.e. use dpkg\-buildpackage without \-B.
.TP
.IR "\-\-force\-orig\-source"
When used with in conjunction with \-s, this option forces the inclusion of the
orig.tar.gz file in the generated .changes file, even in cases where it would
not normally be included, i.e. use dpkg\-buildpackage \-sa.
.TP
.IR \-v , "\-\-verbose"
Be verbose, i.e. all information goes to stdout as well as to the log files.
.TP
.IR \-q , "\-\-quiet"
Be quiet.  This is the opposite of \-\-verbose.
.TP
.IR "\-\-make\-binNMU=<entry>"
With this option, \fBsbuild\fR will create a new changelog entry in
debian/changelog of every package built. The version number will be in the
format for binary-only NMUs (three dotted parts in the Debian revision); the
maintainer is set to the maintainer name configured for \fBsbuild\fR. The
\fIentry\fR parameter will be used as a changelog entry after a fixed one
\[lq]Binary-only non-maintainer upload for ARCH -- no source
changes\[rq]. Please note that the versions in the \fIpackage-to-build\fR
arguments still have to be the unmodified (non-NMU ones) so that sources can be
found. The version number in log files and mails will be modified by
\fBsbuild\fR automatically.
